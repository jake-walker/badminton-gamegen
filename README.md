# Badminton Game Generator

This is a simple web app (and REST API) that makes a list of matches given a list of players.

This project uses Next.js and is deployed on Vercel. The game generation algorithm lives in `packages/generator` and the web app lives at `app`.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd app
bun install  # npm, yarn, pnpm and other node package managers should work too
bun run dev
```
